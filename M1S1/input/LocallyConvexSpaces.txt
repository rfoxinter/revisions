Properties of $A+U$ with $A\subset X$ and $U\subset X$ open;;$A+U$ is open
Existence of symmetric neighbourhoods;;If $W$ is a neighbourhood of $0$ then there exists a neighbourhood $V$ of $0$ such as $V=-V$ and $V+V\subset W$
Link between $\bar A$, $\bar B$ and $\bar{A+B}$;;$\bar A+\bar B\subset\bar{A+B}$
Separation of compac and closed sets in a TVS;;If $X$ is a TVS, $K$ is a compact subset of $X$ and $F$ a closed subset of $X$ then there exists a neighbourhood $V$ of $0$ such that $\l K+V\r\cap\l F+V\r=\varnothing$
Properties of $K+F$ with $K\subset X$ compact and $F\subset X$ closed;;$K+F$ is closed
$A\subset X$ is convex;;$tA+\l1-t\r A\subset A$ for all $t\in\lc0,1\rc$
Properties of $\bar A$ and $\mathring A$ when $A$ is convex;;$\bar A$ and $\mathring{A}$ are convex\linebreak If $\mathring{A}\neq\varnothing$ then $\bar{\mathring A}=\bar A$
$A\subset X$ is absorbing;;$\forall u\in X,\exists t>0,tu\in A$
$A\subset X$ is balanced;;$\forall\left|\lambda\right|\leqslant1,\lambda A\subset A$
Properties of $\appl{p_A}{X}{\mathbb R_+}{u}{\inf{\set{t>0,u\in tA}}}$ for $A\subset X$ absorbing;;$p_A$ is well defined and positively homogeneous, $p_A\l0\r=0$ and $p_A$ is sub-additive\linebreak If $A$ is convex, $\set{p_A\l x\r{<}1}\subset A\subset\set{p_A\l x\r{\leqslant}1}$ and if $A$ is open then $A=\set{p_A\l x\r<1}$\linebreak If $A$ is convex and balanced, $p_A$ is a semi-norm\linebreak If $X$ is a normed space and $A$ is a neighbourhood of the origin then there exists $K\geqslant0$ such that $p_A\l u\r\leqslant K\left\|u\right\|_X$
Fréchet space;;Topological vector space with a compatible metric, that is invariant by translation and with which the space is complete
Necessary condition for $X$ to be a Fréchet space;;If $X$ is endowed with a family of separating semi-norms for which the space is complete then $X$ is a Fréchet space
Bounded set;;$A$ is bounded if for all neighbourhood $V$ of $0$, there exists $t_0>0$ such that, for all $t\geqslant t_0$, $A\subset tV$\linebreak$A$ is bounded if for all neighbourhood $V$ of $0$, there exists $t>0$ such that $A\subset tV$
Basic properties/example of bounded sets;;A subset of a normed space is bounded iff it is contained in $B\l0,R\r$ for $R>0$\linebreak$\set{u_n,n\in\mathbb N}$ for $\l u_n\r$ convergent is bounded\linebreak A finite union/sum of bounded sets is bounded\linebreak A compact set is bounded\linebreak A subset $A$ of a Fréchet space of semi-norms $\l p_n\r$ is bounded iff there exists $\l M_n\r$ such that for all $u\in A$, $p_n\l a\r\leqslant M_n$
Bounded map;;A map is bounded if it maps bounded sets to bounded sets
Link between bounded and continuous linear maps;;A continuous linear map is bounde\linebreak A bounded linear map of a normed vector space is bounded\linebreak In a space with a compatible metric invariant by translation, a bounded linear map is continuous iff it is sequentially continuous at $0$
Linear functional;;Linear map $X\to\mathbb K$ with $X$ a $\mathbb K$-vector space
Hyperplane;;Kernel of a non-trivial linear map\linebreak It has dimension $1$ (the converse holds)
Topological properties of hyperplanes;;Hyperplanes are dense or closed\linebreak Dense iff the associated linear map is continuous
