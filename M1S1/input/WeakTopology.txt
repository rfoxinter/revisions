Weak topology on $X$;;$\sigma\l X,X^*\r$ the initial topology on $X$ associated to its topological dual
Properties of $\l X,\sigma\l X,M\r\r$ for $X$ a TVS over $\mathbb K$ and $M\subset\mathcal L\l X,\mathbb K\r$ that separates points;;It is an LCTVS\linebreak Its topological dual is $M$\linebreak A neighbourhood basis of the origin is given by $V_{\phi,\epsilon}=\set{u\in X,\vala{\phi\l u\r}<\epsilon}$
